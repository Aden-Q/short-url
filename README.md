# Go Web App Template
This is a template to bootstrap building Web applications in Go. It is kept small and bare for better extensibility.

We use the command runner [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a makefile alternative.

The current components include:
+ A bare bone Web app 
+ Version bump and autotag for release
+ A simple CI workflow running with GitHub Actions
